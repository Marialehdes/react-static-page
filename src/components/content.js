            This story is about a boy named Jack who lived in the countryside with his mother. They were very poor, and they owned a cow, but it was not producing milk, and they did not have anything to eat. Jacks mother told him to take the cow to the market and see what they would get for the cow. It was a long way from his house to the market, so Jack decided to take a shortcut. He saw a strange man and explained what he was doing. The man said it was a long way and offered 5 magic beans for the cow, so he didn't have to go all the way to the market.

            When he got back home and explained to his mother he got the beans for the cow, his mother was not happy with it. She tossed them out the window, and jack went straight to bed. When he woke up, a giant beanstalk had sprouted up from the grass all the way to the clouds. He climbed all the way up until he saw a rode in the clouds which he followed up to a castle. He was hungry and curious, so he knocked, and a giant woman answered. She fed him and told him to hide because the woman's husband had come home.

            When he saw a beautiful red hen lay a golden egg, he went to see it up close and the hen spoke to him and asked for help. He decided to help her and invited her to live with him. Jack and his mother were very happy. Until one day he heard someone singing, he climbed up the beanstalk again, and walked all the way to the castle, the woman was upset and she shut the door in his face, but he still was curious and climbed through a window. The husband demanded for his golden harp, which sang a lullaby to help him sleep. The harp asked jack for help. Jack decided to help him, but the giant chased after jack. Once he landed, he got an ax from his mother and began to cut the beanstalk. The giant saw he would fall and ran back up. The harp was very happy and decided to stay with jack. With the hen and the harp jack and his mother lived very well and were never hungry again.
